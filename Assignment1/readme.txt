Various sorts and their comparison graphs. Includes a python file for generating plots for all the sorts. Can be easily extended for including 
different sorts and plots.
C files: main.c, functions.c, functions.h
python files: plot.py
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1> Build Instruction: gcc main.c functions.c 

2> running: ./a.out

3> this will generate dat files for each run with time comparison metrices

4> If the dat files are generated "plot.py" will generate all the plots when run in the same folder using python. (Matplotlib needs to be installed)




* This folder already includes one set of generated dat and png files. if you follow steps 1-4 they will be rewritten with new results.



Thank you!
