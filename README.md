# Algorithms
Implementation of algorithmic problems in c as part of Mtech Course.

# Topics
* Comparison of runtime of recursive and iterative versions of quicksort, mergesort, heapsort.
* Various graph algorithms.
# includes
## Assignment 1
* Random array generator of given size
* timing fuctions
* Sort checking function
* recursive and iterative versions of quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
* plotting using pyplot and saving to png files.
* Various sorts and their comparison graphs. Includes a python file for generating plots for all the sorts. Can be easily extended for including different sorts and plots.
##Assignment 2
* Graph DFS,Bridge,AP,Strongly connected component, Dijsktra, kruskal.
* Graph ADT and library functions for linked list and matrix representation.
* Function to create graph from array.
